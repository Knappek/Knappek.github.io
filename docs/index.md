# Welcome to my Technical Scratchpad

I use this page to document all kinds of stuff because I am getting old and rusty and forget things.
So this page is mainly for me but I'm happy if others can benefit from it as well :slight_smile:.

If you have any questions, feedback or other comments to certain pages, please let me know by either [creating a github issue](https://github.com/Knappek/Knappek.github.io/issues/new) or [email me](mailto:andy.knapp.ak@gmail.com).
